# GUITAR GUY

## Description

This is a simple Guitar Hero-style rhythm game built using [raylib](https://www.raylib.com/) in C. It supports a basic note map format, four key inputs, scoring, visual feedback, and displays the song title and artist.

## üéÆ Features

- 4 playable columns: `A`, `S`, `D`, `F` keys
- Color-coded note columns: green, red, blue, yellow
- Smooth note fall and hit detection
- Anti-spam scoring logic (prevents holding down keys)
- Visual feedback for button presses and successful hits
- Song metadata display (title + artist)
- Simple map parser from `.chart` file
- Uses `raylib` for graphics

## üìÅ Map File Format
Place map files in the `assets/maps` directory. Maps use the following `.chart` format:

```
[Song]
Name = "Song Title"
Artist = "Artist Name"
Offset = 0
Resolution = 192
Difficulty = 1
Tempo = 500000
Notes = 262

[Track]
0 = N 0
576 = N 1
768 = N 3
1056 = N 2
...
```
- `Offset`: Seconds to delay before the first note.
- `Resolution`: Ticks per beat (like MIDI PPQ).
- `Tempo`: Microseconds per beat.
- `Track` entries define notes by tick and column (0-3).
